# Assignment 4 - Final Project Summary
**1. What is the goal of your application?**

The goal of my web application is to provide a simple platform where users will be able to adopt pets. They will be able to view a list of pets that are up for adoption along with the contact information of the pets' owners. All of the pets' information (breed type, size, age, etc.) will also be displayed. Registered users of the application will be able to put their pets up for adoption, while unregistered users will only be able to view a list of pets that are up for adoption. Users who choose to sign in will also be able to favorite pets that they are interested in. 

**2. Who is the primary audience?**

The primary audience of my web application will range from young to middle aged adults who are looking to adopt a pet or put a pet up for adoption. Users who are looking to adopt a pet will most likely be part of the younger-middle generation since they are looking to start a new family. 

**3. What will the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations be?**

Create: Registered users will be able to list a pet up for adoption  
Read: Users will be able to view a list of pets that are up for adoption  
Update: Registered users will be able to update their listed pets' profiles  
Delete: Registered users will be able to remove their pet from the adoption list

**4. What additional feature would you like to build?**

My web application will have a favorite section that will display all the favorited pets of a registered user. Users who are signed in will be able to add a pet that they are interested in by clicking on the favorite button next to the pet's profile. In the favorite section, there will be information of each favorited pet which includes the timestap of when the user favorited the pet and a remove button in case the user chooses to unfavorite the pet.
